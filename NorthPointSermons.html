            Before us is an 7 week sermon series on the importance of our identity in Christ and how to live with conviction and courage!
            <br>
            <br> July 8 - “Discovering My Life In Christ” Who am I? What would your life be like without the grace of God in Jesus Christ? Who exactly are you because of Him and what difference does that really make in your life? Today I want to help
            you create a Positive ID! You will see that there is no reason for you to be “down” on yourself after you hear this message today! God wants you to see who you really are in His eternal plan and that you have every reason to live your life
            with courage and hope! Read I Peter 2:9-10; Titus 3:7; Philippians 4:13
            <br>
            <br> July 15 - “It Is Not Easy Being Me!” Life is tough! Countless things can come at you to really discourage you. It takes courage to keep on keeping on and move forward with confidence and hope. That is what I want to talk about with you
            today. Read 2 Corinthians 4:8-9; Job 3:11-20; Job 11:13-18
            <br>
            <br> July 22 - “The Courage I Need To Fulfill My Destiny!” God has made each of us with purpose. He calls us by His grace to shape the future. We don’t see that future clearly, but God does. He comes before us this Sunday to give us the courage
            we need to be what He is calling us to be for Him! Read Numbers 13:27-14:9; Joshua 14:10-12a; Acts 13:36; I Thes. 5:24
            <br>
            <br> July 29 – “The Courage I Need To Stand Up For The Truth” As you live your life would you say that you regularly stand up for what you believe OR do you find yourself cowering away in silence? Do often times feel regretful because you
            did not say something that you know needed to be said? Do you wish that you could change that and things would be different for you? Then today’s message from God is just what you need. Read Philippians 2:4-5; Acts 5:28-29; Hebrews 6:18; Acts
            4:13
            <br>
            <br> August 5 – “The Courage I Need To Face My Faults” It is not easy to look in the mirror and see ourselves just the way we are. Sometimes I think people try to put their make up on before they open their eyes because they don’t want to
            see themselves just the way they are. Of course, I must be talking only about women, because don’t have that problem! If you believe that, I have a bridge. We all have faults. We all have character flaws. We all have weaknesses…BUT do we have
            the courage to face them? That is what this Sunday is all about: Finding the courage to face your faults! Read 2 Corinthians 13:5; Philippians 3:8; John 9:40-41; Mark 7:20-23
            <br>
            <br> August 12 – “The Courage I Need To Face My Insecurities” Not only do I have faults, but I have insecurities…and what I fear I do not like to think about! Do you find that you are insecure about yourself? You have a lot of self-doubt!
            Have you ever wondered how you can get beyond your doubts and have some confidence? In order to do that you need to face your insecurities and that is what this message is all about. Read Exodus 3:7-14; Romans 12:2; Psalm 8:3-5; Psalm 139:13
            <br>
            <br> August 19 – “Understanding What Makes You, You…And Making The Most Of It!” Do you understand what makes you, you? We are all different! Even twins have differences! We all have different strengths and different weaknesses! Each of us
            is pretty complex when it comes right down to it! You are put together in a marvelous way so that you can be you! But let me ask you this: Are you making the most out of what it means to be YOU? I pray that this week’s message can help you
            answer that question as never before! Read Psalm 139:14; Romans 8:27-29; Matthew 25:14-30
